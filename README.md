#### Description: Python Pygame game

"Space Wars" is a game written in Python using Pygame. Inspired by old spaceships fight games.

It's a challenging single-player game where you can play against 4 types of bots: Easy, Medium, Hard, and Impossible.

After defeating one of the bots, you earn money. Which can be used to buy upgrades.

main.py contains pretty much everything that makes the game run.
config.ini is just a save file to save player's data.
Encryptor.py contains some functions to encrypt and decypt text that I made myself. Just so players don't cheat :)
Assets folder contains all the assets such as images and audio files.
